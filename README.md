1.	Project topic and description:
When a person enters into cardiac arrest in a hospital, there are some very well defined steps to go through to perform a successful CPR. These steps need to be remembered thoughtfully by the head of the resuscitation team but they may change according to the patient's condition. Also, the hour of administration of each medication needs to be considered and registered, nowadays that job is done by a second individual writing the information on a whiteboard. All this considered, there is much space for human error and wasted human resources.
2.	Project purpose/goals:
The proposal comprehends the development of a mobile application according to the ACLS (Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support) guidelines. It would be able to lead the personnel through the flow chart and also register the time of each drug administration, so it will inform the team when it is safe to administrate medications or to continue the compressions. Therefore, giving less space to human errors and reducing the waste of human resources.
