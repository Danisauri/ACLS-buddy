Project topic and description:
Even though the resuscitation of a person is a very critical effort in medicine it still has some very large space for human-error. The algorithm designed by the AHA on its ACLS course constantly changes, there is one high-skilled member of the resuscitation team whose sole responsibility is to write-down times on a whiteboard, and there is no feedback to the team about their performance rates. These things considered, ‘ACLS buddy’ was conceived. ACLS buddy is a mobile app that will assist resuscitation teams on the decision-making process, release one member of the team of his/her current duties, improve the accuracy of the patient’s records, and provide feedback about the outcomes of the efforts.
